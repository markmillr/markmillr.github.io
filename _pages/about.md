<p>We may very well actually live on the best of all possible worlds. Our understanding of Earth’s climate system is powerfully augmented by data from 1) other planets and 2) the geologic past. Paleoclimate records as well as observations from planet-like bodies both serve as base cases for refining conceptual and numerical models of Earth’s climate physics.</p>

<p>One important message that planetary and exoplanet research tells us is that planets can take a wide variety of forms depending on their elemental abundances, size, and relationship with their host star. Meanwhile paleoclimate and paleoceanographic research shows us that life has been a geologic force on planet Earth for the majority of its history, modifying climate parameters through biogeochemical processes. In fact, it is only because of ancient simple life that Earth’s physical environment ever became habitable for humans.</p>

<p>I seek to develop our general understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes that determine planetary conditions. From the airless bodies in our solar system such as the Moon and Mercury, to the runaway greenhouse of Venus, to distant possible magma ocean worlds like 55 Cnc e, there is a rich set of important test cases for framing our understanding of the Earth environment. Likewise, certain episodes from Earth’s environmental history also serve as good test cases, from the proto-Earth, the “Boring Billion” years, and the Snowball Earth periods to the much more recent “Mystery Period” of the last deglaciation, as well as the Anthropocene, in which we now live.</p>

<p>I am developing simple to intermediate-complexity numerical models of planetary environments constrained by paleo, modern, and extraterrestrial observations. As part of this effort I am currently writing the book <b>Modeling Planetary Climates with Python</b>, intended to serve as a tutorial and summary of planetary climate science.</p>

<p>I’m on the lookout for a research group to join, so if you are a researcher with interests in planetary climates, paleoclimate modeling, and/or paleoceanography, I’d love to be in touch.</p>
