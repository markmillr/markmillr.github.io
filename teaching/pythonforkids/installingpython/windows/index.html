Installation of required software before class (Windows):
</strong>

<br>
<br>
First determine what version of Windows you have (XP, 8, 10, etc.), and write this information down, because you may need it. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">How to find out which Windows operating system you are running</a></font> 
<br>
<br>
We'll also need to find out whether our Windows is the 32-bit or 64-bit version, and write this down, because we may need it.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">How to determine whether a computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system</a></font> 

<br>
<br>
1) Install Sublime Text 3
<br>
<br>
Go to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">Sublime Text's website</a></font> and download Sublime Text 3 for Windows. 

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/sublimedownloadwindows.png">
<br>
<br>

Click on "DOWNLOAD FOR WINDOWS", double check the filename to make sure that they are giving you the correct version (the 32-bit or 64-bit Windows version), and then click "Run" in the window that pops up at the bottom of the screen. Click "Yes" when asked if you would like to allow the installer to make changes to your computer. This will open up a Setup Wizard for Sublime Text 3:

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/sublimewindowswizard.png">
<br>
<br>



Find Sublime Text 3 on your Windows computer and open it. Success! This is where we will write our Python code with lots of pretty colors that are helpful for programming. I used Sublime Text to write the static HTML for this barebones, poorly written, bare minimum static webpage. 


<br>
<br>

What you will get by downloading Sublime Text is a free trial that basically lasts forever. If you are feeling generous you can pay the developer who took the time to make Sublime Text by buying a license to register it.

<br>
<br>

If you want to play with Sublime Text a little bit, write a haiku and save it as a ".txt" file.

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsHaiku.png">

<br>
<br>

In class we will use Sublime Text to write and edit Python files (".py").

<br>
<br>

2) Install Anaconda


<br>
<br>

Go to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">Anaconda's download website</a></font> and download Anaconda for Windows. Make sure to download the 64-bit or 32-bit version, as appropriate. 

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/Windowsanacondadownloadpage.png">

<br>
<br>

Click "Run" and Anaconda will start downloading. This could take a half hour or more, depending on your internet speed.

<br>
<br>

Click through the buttons that appear in order to install Anaconda:

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaSetup1.png">

<br>
<br>

Make sure that BOTH "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" AND "Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.7" are CHECKED. Ignore any warnings. If you don't check both boxes, things could get complicated.

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaSetup2.png">

<br>
<br>

Now it will take a few minutes to install Anaconda.

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaSetup3.png">

<br>
<br>

Find Anaconda in your Windows Menu and open the Anaconda Navigator:

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaMenu.png">

<br>
<br>

Decide whether you want to share usage information with Anaconda. I don't think it matters much either way.

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaSharing.png">

<br><br>

You can uncheck both boxes shown below:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaThanks.png">

<br><br>

You also don't need Microsoft VSCode, so skip through this dialogue.

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsAnacondaMicrosoft.png">

<br><br>

Now this step will seem strange, but when Anaconda Navigator opens up, just close it because we don't really need it right now.

<br><br>

Python should be installed on our machine, so let's check it by opening up the Command Prompt. The Command Prompt is how we talk to a Windows computer using the keyboard.
<br><br>
Type "cmd" in the Windows search box and then click on the Command Prompt app that appears.
<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsCommandPromptMenu.png">

<br><br>

Now a window containing the Command Prompt should appear. It will look something like this: 

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsCommandPrompt.png">

<br><br>

If Anaconda did what we expect it to do, then it should have installed Python 3.7 on our Windows machine and set our machine up so that we can start the Python interpreter (dialogue) by typing "python" at the Command Prompt:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsCommandPromptPython.png">

<br><br>

If you see something like the above screenshot, SUCCESS! You have Python on your machine. If not, you will receive an error message. Get in touch with me if this hasn't worked.

<br><br>

Where you see ">>>" is the Python interpreter, a place where you can talk directly to your computer in Python. It's kind of like going to Mexico and knowing that it is a place where people speak Spanish.

<br><br>

The traditional first program in any programming language is to print "Hello, World!" to the output. Let's make this a special one by writing "Hello, Susanville!" Type the following: print("Hello, Susanville!")
<br> Then press enter. <br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsCommandPromptPythonHelloWorld.png">

<br><br>

Well done, you have successfully installed Python on your machine and run your first line of Python code! Most teachers agree that this part should be easier than it is, but the good news is that this is kind of the hardest part about getting started with Python.

<br><br>


Now check to see that Anaconda installed the Turtle drawing library for us by typing "import turtle" in the Python interpreter:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsCommandPromptPythonImportTurtle.png">

<br><br>

If you hit enter and get no error message and just another Python interpreter prompt (>>>), SUCCESS! Turtles has been installed, and we can soon draw our first patterns with Python. <br><br>

We are technically done and ready for class, so can stop here if you like! 

<br><br>What follows from here is a set of optional challenges for those who are interested. Don't worry if you can't do it, I will teach students how in class.

<br><br>

CHALLENGE: What we should do now as a reward is draw a pretty picture using Python. 

<br><br>

To do this we will write our first Python script in the Sublime editor. Right now you can quit the Python interpreter and go back to the command line by typing "quit()". Make a folder called "learnpython" in a convenient location on your computer (your Desktop is fine). Then open Sublime and use File->Save As... to save an empty file in the "learnpython" folder. Call the file "star.py". Now type the following code into your first Python script:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/WindowsSublimeStarCode.png">

<br><br>

Once you have saved the star.py file in the learnpython folder, go to the Command Prompt and navigate to the learnpython folder. This will probably require the commands "cd" (for change directory) and "dir" (for listing the directory). You might need to do some Googling to learn how to use the Windows Command Prompt. Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly what commands you will need to use to navigate to the right folder because everybody has their files and directories in different places. 

<br><br>
But once you reach the learnpython folder you created, type  "python star.py" in the Command Prompt. Take a picture using your phone, save the file, or print out the result. Bring the image to class to show that you've succeeded in installing and using Python to draw an interesting figure that will look something like this image (but with different colors):

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/turtle-star.png">

<br><br>

Good luck!
