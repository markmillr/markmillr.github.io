<strong>
Installation of required software before class (macOS):
</strong>

<br>
<br>
First determine what version of Mac operating system you have (Mojave, High Sierra,  etc.), and write this information down, because you may need it. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">Find out which macOS your Mac is using.</a></font> Generally, it's best to have the latest possible version, which is currently Mojave (macOS 10.14.3).
<br>
<br>
We'll also need to find out whether our Mac is the 32-bit or 64-bit version, and write this down, because we may need it. 32-bit Macs are just about obsolete now and will probably not be able to correctly run the required software.
<a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tips/how-to/mac-32-bit-64-bit/" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">How to Tell if Your Mac is 32-bit or 64-bit.</a></font> 

<br>
<br>
1) Install Sublime Text 3
<br>
<br>
Go to <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">Sublime Text's website</a></font> and download Sublime Text 3 for Mac. 

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSublimeDownloadScreenshot.png">
<br>
<br>

Click on "DOWNLOAD FOR MAC", then double click on the Sublime Text dmg package that appears in your Downloads. In Safari this looks like:

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSublimeDMGscreenshot.png">
<br>
<br>

In the window that appears, drag the "Sublime Text.app" to the "Applications" folder:

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSublimeTextDragToApplications.png">

<br>
<br>

Find Sublime Text 3 in your Launchpad and open it. 




Success! This is where we will write our Python code with lots of pretty colors that are helpful for programming. I used Sublime Text to write the static HTML for this barebones, poorly written, bare minimum static webpage. 


<br>
<br>

What you will get by downloading Sublime Text is a free trial that basically lasts forever. If you are feeling generous you can pay the developer who took the time to make Sublime Text by buying a license to register it.

<br>
<br>

If you want to play with Sublime Text a little bit, try to write the world's worst haiku and save it as a ".txt" file. Here's one terrible haiku:

<br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSublimeHaiku.png">

<br>
<br>

In class we will use Sublime Text to write and edit Python files (".py"), just like many professional programmers.

<br>
<br>

2) Install Anaconda


<br>
<br>

Go to <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" style="color: rgb(6,69,173)"><font color="0645AD">Anaconda's download website</a></font> and download Anaconda for Mac.  

<br>
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaDownload.png">

<br>
<br>

Download the Python 3.7 version for Mac and Anaconda will start downloading. This file is over 650 MB and could take a half hour or more, depending on your internet speed.

<br>
<br>

Double click on the Anaconda package file in the Downloads area (in the upper right corner of Safari). <br>
<br>
<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSafariAnacondaDownloads.png">

<br>
<br>

Anaconda is considered to be a trustworthy source so say yes to trusting their software... 


<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaInstallerTrusted.png">

<br>
<br>

Click through the license and questions to proceed with the Anaconda Installation. 

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaBeginInstall.png">

<br>
<br>

This may take 10-20 minutes and will require a lot of storage, more than 2 GB.

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaInstallWriting.png">

<br>
<br>




You don't need Microsoft VSCode, so skip through this dialogue and close the Anaconda installer.

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaInstallMicrosoft.png">

<br><br>

Now we're done installing Anaconda:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacAnacondaInstallComplete.png">

<br><br>

Python 3.7 should be installed on our machine now, so let's check by opening up the Terminal. The Terminal is how we talk to a Mac/Linux/Unix computer using the keyboard.
<br><br>
There are a couple of ways to open up Mac's Terminal application. One is to use the Launchpad and look or search for the Terminal icon:
<br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacLaunchpad.png">

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacLaunchpadView.png">

<br><br>

Click through to the "Other" area of the Launchpad view to find the Terminal app:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacLaunchpadOther.png">

<br><br>

Now a window containing the Terminal should appear. It will look something like this, possibly with different colors (these are customizable): 

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacTerminalView.png">

<br><br>

If Anaconda did what we expect it to do, then it should have installed Python 3.7 on our Windows machine and set our machine up so that we can start the Python interpreter (dialogue) by typing "python" at the Terminal prompt (the dollar sign "$"):

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacTerminalPythonSuccess.png">

<br><br>

If you see something like the above screenshot, with Python 3.7 or above, SUCCESS! You have Python on your machine. If not, you will receive an error message. Get in touch with me if this hasn't worked.

<br><br>

Where you see ">>>" is the Python interpreter, a place where you can talk directly to your computer in Python. It's kind of like going to Mexico and knowing that it is a place where people speak Spanish.

<br><br>

The traditional first program in any programming language is to print "Hello, World!" to the output. Let's make this a special one by writing "Hello, Susanville!"

<br><br> Type the following: print("Hello, Susanville!")
<br><br> Then press enter. <br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacTerminalPythonHelloWorld.png">

<br><br>

Well done, you have successfully installed Python on your machine and run your first line of Python code! Most teachers agree that this part should be easier than it is, but the good news is that this is kind of the hardest part about getting started with Python.

<br><br>


Now check to see that Anaconda installed the Turtle drawing library for us by typing "import turtle" in the Python interpreter:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacTerminalPythonImportTurtle.png">

<br><br>

If you hit enter and get no error message and just another Python interpreter prompt (>>>), SUCCESS! Turtles has been installed, and we can soon draw our first patterns with Python. <br><br>

We are technically done and ready for class, so you can stop here if you like!

<br><br>
 What follows from here is a set of optional challenges for those who are interested. Don't worry if you can't do it, I will teach students how in class.

<br><br>

CHALLENGE: What we should do now as a reward is draw a pretty picture using Python. 

<br><br>

To do this we will write our first Python script in the Sublime editor. Right now you can quit the Python interpreter and go back to the command line by typing "quit()". Make a folder called "learnpython" in a convenient location on your computer (your Desktop is fine). Then open Sublime and use File->Save As... to save an empty file in the "learnpython" folder. Call the file "star.py". Now type the following code into your first Python script:

<br><br>

<img src="https://markmillr.github.io/assets/img/MacSublimeStarCode.png">

<br><br>

Once you have saved the star.py file in the learnpython folder, go to the Terminal and navigate to the learnpython folder. This will probably require the commands "cd" (for change directory) and "ls" (for listing the contents of the directory). You might need to do some Googling to learn how to use the Mac Terminal. Linux Terminal commands are basically exactly the same, so you can use those too! Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly what commands you will need to use to navigate to the right folder because everybody has their files and directories in different places. 

<br><br>
But once you reach the learnpython folder you created, type  "python star.py" in the Terminal. Bring a picture of the result to class to show that you've succeeded in installing and using Python to draw an interesting figure. Challenge overcome!

<br><br>

<br><br>

Good luck!
