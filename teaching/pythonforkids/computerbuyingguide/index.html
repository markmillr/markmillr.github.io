<strong>Mark's opinionated guide to buying a laptop (Feb 2019)</strong>

Buying a personal computer is a big investment, but if your student is college-bound, they will need one anyway down the road. With good reason, personal computers have long been required for students at many universities such as the University of California. Here are the current personal computer requirements for UC Davis, which I fully agree with:

<strong>Windows or Mac?*</strong>

Let me put it simply: If all you have or can afford is a Windows laptop that meets the above requirements, then that is fine. But Apple's MacBooks are in my experience much better suited to the work of most knowledge and creative professionals. Every scientific laboratory and computing group I have ever worked in uses Macs. I use my computer every day for work, and since my first MacBook purchase I have never looked back. There is no need for antivirus software, a 3-year warranty (Apple Care) is available for new machines, and the operating system is fast and reliable. If you ever need to run Windows programs (which I sometimes have to for work on certain projects), there are options for running Windows on a Mac. Some annoying aspects of Windows are that it always seems to run slow, and it will sometimes just decide it's time for a software update without asking your permission. In my view, the only real downside of Macs is that they are expensive.

<strong>Other notes</strong>

Have a backup plan! Always backup your computer's data, because failures can and do happen. I use Mac's Time Machine to back up to a 2 terabyte mobile usb drive by G Drive.

<strong>Obsolete computers</strong>

Here are the types of computers that UC Davis considers obsolete:

<strong>This is too complicated! Just tell me what to buy!</strong>

I'm a bit uncomfortable making this kind of recommendation. There are perfectly good Windows machines that will work just fine. However if you're sure that your kid is going to college, I would recommend a recent refurbished and certified MacBook Air or Pro, 2015 or newer, with a solid state hard drive (SSD, no moving parts) that has at least 250 GB of storage and is eligible for some sort of multi-year warranty like Apple Care. 8 GB of RAM works fine for me, but if you foresee a bunch of video editing, the more RAM and hard drive storage, the better. If you can buy Apple Care, do it.

<strong>*What about Linux? (in case you have a programmer friend who cares about that sort of thing)</strong>

I have a few bright and passionate programmer friends who refuse to use the operating systems sold by the evil corporate monsters Microsoft and Apple. For them, there is a family of alternative, free, open source operating systems called Linux. Most of the internet is powered by Linux servers, and Linux is a powerful and efficient computing environment. There are even several versions of Linux that have the same graphical user interface as Mac and Windows. However because it is open source and often full of bugs (little errors), the use of Linux on personal computers is something that is more for advanced purists. I have a laptop that runs Linux Ubuntu Desktop, and although it pretty much works okay most of the time, it is full of bugs and problems and is not suitable for professional purposes. So Linux PCs: a great ideal but still not there.

The good news is that the Mac operating system has at its core a form of Unix (the corporate predecessor to Linux) which has practically the same powerful functionality as Linux-based web servers and supercomputers. This is one of the most important reasons that for most students who might learn programming, a Mac is a great advantage. </article>
